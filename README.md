#Speech To Text for the hard of hearing

"index.html" is a modified sample Bing Speech API file retrieved from Microsoft which utilises the speech recognition SDK.
The modifications include changing default configuration options and functions to open a POST request to a server hosted with server.js
as well as displaying a URL to the page which contains the outputted speech-to-text.


There does exist an issue where the speech recognition will not initially work and may take many refreshes before functioning as it should. This may be an issue with the API.
